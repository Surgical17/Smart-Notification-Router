## 🚀 Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

#### Option 1: Pull from GitHub Container Registry

```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/surgical17/smart-notification-router:main

# Run with environment variables
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL=file:/app/prisma/dev.db \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here \
  -e AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -v smart-router-data:/app/prisma \
  ghcr.io/surgical17/smart-notification-router:main
```

#### Option 2: Docker Compose (with pre-built image)

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  smart-notification-router:
    image: ghcr.io/surgical17/smart-notification-router:main
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=file:/app/prisma/dev.db
      - AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
      - AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    volumes:
      - smart-router-data:/app/prisma
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  smart-router-data:
```

#### Option 3: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Surgical17/smart-notification-router.git
cd smart-notification-router

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set AUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

- Nagios reports down → wait
- Zabbix confirms → wait
- Prometheus confirms → **ALERT!**

### Multi-Region Deployment Tracking
Track deployments across regions and alert when all complete:
- US-East deployed → wait
- EU-West deployed → wait
- AP-Southeast deployed → **SUCCESS!**

### Distributed System Health
Correlate health checks from multiple services:
- Database healthy → wait
- Cache healthy → wait
- API healthy → **ALL SYSTEMS GO!**
